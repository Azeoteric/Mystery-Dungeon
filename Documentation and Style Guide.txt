					***Comments***
Use  /// at the top line of each action to tell what it does.

For scripts you should use ///  at the top line to show what parameters it takes in (if any).

Use // for comments explaining what said block of code does.





					***Naming***

Sprites should be named like spr_name.

Backgrounds should be named like bg_name.

Rooms should be named like rm_name.

Objects should be named like obj_name.

Scripts should be named like scr_name.

Fonts should be named like fnt_name.

Sounds should be named like snd_name.

Boolean variables should be named like is_action to make them stand out.

Variables should describe what they represent. (No letters unless for interation of loops)



				***Coding*** 

				
Limit magic numbers!!
Only use numbers in the create eventx` of objects. 

For nested statements indent so it its easier to show scope.

Use Marcos to hold any constants that will be global and should not change in-game.

Declare fields and local variables one per line.

Put the body of if statements on the line after the condition.

Put spaces in between math opperators so x*3+4/y should be x * 3 + 4 / y.




This:

	if (cond) {
		scr_action();
	}

is preferable to:

	if (cond == true) {
	   scr_action();
	}


This:

	if (!cond) {
		scr_action();
	}
is preferable to:

	if (cond == false) {
		scr_action();
	}
	
This:

	x += 1;
	
is preferable to:

	x = x + 1;
